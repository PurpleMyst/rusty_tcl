rusty-tcl-sys
=============

`rusty-tcl-sys` is a package that contains Rust FFI declarations for the tcl
library.

Currently it provides bindings for TCL 8.5, but in the future we will support
more versions under feature flags.

If you're looking for TCL rust bindings, see [`rusty-tcl`](https://crates.io/crates/rusty-tcl)
